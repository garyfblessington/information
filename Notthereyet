Sorry folks. - Can't help here. - I was enthused when i read about Solid (at first). As i explored it, i discovered it is still 
a work very much in progress. I thought the Solid-IDE would be helpful, BUt i have no way of knowing how to make it a "Tool"
on Solid! - - - If i cannot upload and down load files and organize and arrange them with reasonable convenience, i don't want
to use it. - - -
